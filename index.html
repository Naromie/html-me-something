     <p> I have been in Cananada in many different season
         Summer;Fall;Sprint; Winter</p>
    
    <p>My Last trip was last Winter and this was the 
            one that really stuck with me</p>

            I have spent 21  Days there and I have never
             been outside.
             It kept snowing all day long.
             A day that a people from New York would tag as a storm or a blizzard is like a regular snowing day for Canadians.
